## ðŸ“‹ **Migration Pattern**

### **Composables Pattern**

```js
// Before
const update = (options = {}) => {
    const builtInOnSuccess = (data) => {
        // Cache management logic
    };

    return useMutation({
        mutationFn: (params) => api.update(params),
        ...chainCallbacks(builtInOnSuccess, null, options),
    });
};

// After
const update = (options = {}) => {
    return useMutation({
        mutationFn: (params) => api.update(params),
        onSuccess: (data) => {
            // Cache management logic
        },
        ...options,
    });
};
```

### **UI Components Pattern**

```js
// Before
updateMutation.mutate(data, {
    onSuccess: (result) => {
        /* handle success */
    },
});

// After
updateMutation
    .mutateAsync(data)
    .then((response) => {
        const unwrappedData = response.form; // Unwrap if needed
        // handle success
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // handle error
    });
```

## âœ… **Final Cleanup** (COMPLETED!) ðŸŽ‰

-   [x] âœ… Removed `chainCallbacks` utility from `client/composables/query/index.js`
-   [x] âœ… Removed all `chainCallbacks` imports from composables
-   [x] âœ… Ready for testing - all mutations now use native handlers

## ðŸ“Š **Progress Summary**

-   **COMPLETED**: 100% ðŸŽ‰
-   **Query Composables**: 28/28 methods (100%) âœ…
-   **UI Components**: 5/5 components (100%) âœ…
-   **Final Cleanup**: 3/3 tasks (100%) âœ…

### **Total Migration Count**

-   **Query Methods**: 28 mutations migrated from chainCallbacks
-   **UI Components**: 2 components migrated to mutateAsync
-   **Files Modified**: 11 composables + 2 UI components + 1 cleanup file

---

## ðŸŽ‰ **MIGRATION COMPLETE!**

âœ… **All chainCallbacks have been successfully migrated to native TanStack Query handlers!**

### **What was accomplished:**

1. **Removed chainCallbacks utility** - Eliminated the custom callback chaining system
2. **Migrated all composables** - 28 mutations across 11 files now use native `onSuccess`/`onError`
3. **Updated UI components** - 2 components converted from callback pattern to `mutateAsync`
4. **Cleaner codebase** - No more complex callback chaining, just clean promise-based code

### **Benefits gained:**

-   âœ… **Better error handling** with native promise chains
-   âœ… **Cleaner code** without callback wrapper complexity
-   âœ… **Better debugging** with standard TanStack Query patterns
-   âœ… **Future-proof** code following TanStack Query best practices

### **Ready for testing!** ðŸš€

The application is now ready for thorough testing to ensure all mutations work correctly with the new native handlers.
