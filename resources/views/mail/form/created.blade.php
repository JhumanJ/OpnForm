Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Congrats! Your form "{{$form->title}}" was successfully created!

If you want to share your form, here is the link:

If you want to **embed your form in Notion**, simply type "/embed", confirm, and paste the URL above.
If you want to add the form to your website, copy and paste the following code:
