title: Environment Variables
description: Detailed guide on configuring environment variables for OpnForm
---

OpnForm uses two `.env` files for configuration: one for the Laravel backend located in the `api` directory, and one for the Nuxt front-end located in the `client` directory.

## Backend Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used to [configure the Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/configuration) application (OpnForm's API).

### Dedicated guides

There are dedicated configuration pages available for more detailed setup instructions on specific topics:

-   [OAuth Integration Setup](../configuration/oauth-setup)
-   [File Storage (S3)](../configuration/aws-s3)
-   [Email Configuration (SMTP)](../configuration/email-setup)
-   [Custom Domain](../configuration/custom-domain)
-   [Subdomain Redirect Configuration](../configuration/subdomain-redirect)

### OAuth Integration Environment Variables

OAuth integrations enable user authentication and third-party service connections. OpnForm automatically handles OAuth redirect URLs - you don't need to manually configure redirect URIs in your OAuth applications.

<Info>
    For detailed setup instructions for each OAuth provider, see the [OAuth
    Integration Setup](../configuration/oauth-setup) guide.

### User Options Environment Variables

| Variable Name             | Description                                                                                     |

### PHP Configuration Environment Variables

| Variable Name             | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT`        | Maximum amount of memory a script may consume.      |

These PHP configuration variables are particularly important when handling file uploads and processing large amounts of data. If any of these variables are not set, PHP will use its default values from the php.ini configuration. When using Docker, these values are set in the docker-compose.yml file. For non-Docker installations, you'll need to configure these values in your PHP configuration (php.ini) file.

### Database Configuration Environment Variables

These variables are essential for connecting the Laravel backend to your database.

| `DB_HOST`       | The database server host (e.g., `127.0.0.1`). |
| `DB_PORT`       | The database server port (e.g., `3306`).      |
| `DB_DATABASE`   | The name of the database.                     |
| `DB_USERNAME`   | The username for connecting to the database.  |

### Anonymous Telemetry

OpnForm tracks usage of its products which helps the team to improve and deliver better software. You can opt-out of this telemetry at any time.

**What data is collected?**

None of your customer data is ever transmitted by OpnForm installation. The telemetry data collected are purely usage statistics of various software features:

- Basic usage metrics (form creation, submissions, workspace creation, user additions)
- Anonymous instance identifier (UUID)
- Distribution of forms by type
- No personally identifiable information (PII)
- No form content, submission data, or user emails

**How is the data used?**

This data will only be used by OpnForm team for:

- Directly improving the product and identifying the parts of product which are popular
- Identifying areas with limited usage or where our users get stuck
- Prioritizing the next set of features to be developed

**When is telemetry active?**

- Production environments (`APP_ENV=production`)
- Self-hosted deployments (`SELF_HOSTED=true`)
- Disabled in local/development environments

**How to opt-out:**

Set `OPNFORM_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in your environment variables to disable data collection.

## Docker Environment Variables

When running OpnForm with Docker, there are some important considerations for handling environment variables:

### Updating Environment Variables

When changing environment variables in your `.env` files, you need to recreate the containers for the changes to take effect. Simply restarting the containers is not sufficient as Docker only loads environment variables when containers are created.

To apply new environment variable changes:

```bash
# For a specific service (e.g., ui)
docker compose down ui
docker compose up -d ui

# For all services
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

<Warning>
    A simple `docker compose restart` will not reload environment variables from
    your `.env` files. You must use `down` and `up` commands to recreate the
    containers.
</Warning>
