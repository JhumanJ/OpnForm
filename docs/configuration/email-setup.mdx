This page explains how to configure email notifications in OpnForm.

By default, with a new Docker deployment, the email driver used is `log`, which simply logs the emails instead of sending them. To enable actual email sending, you need to set up a proper email configuration.

OpnForm uses Laravel's mail system. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Laravel Mail documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/mail).

## Supported Mail Drivers

Laravel supports various mail drivers, including SMTP, Mailgun, Postmark, Amazon SES, and more. In this guide, we'll focus on setting up SMTP, which is widely used.

## Configuring SMTP Settings

To configure SMTP, you need to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MAIL_MAILER` | Set this to `smtp` to use the SMTP driver. |
| `MAIL_HOST` | The address of your SMTP server. |
| `MAIL_PORT` | The port used by your SMTP server (common ports are 25, 465, and 587). |
| `MAIL_USERNAME` | The username for your SMTP account. |
| `MAIL_PASSWORD` | The password for your SMTP account. |
| `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` | The encryption method used by your SMTP server (typically `tls` or `ssl`). |
| `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | The email address that emails should be sent from. |
| `MAIL_FROM_NAME` | The name that should appear as the sender of the emails. |
