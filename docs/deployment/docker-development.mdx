## Overview

OpnForm provides a minimal Docker-based development environment optimized for local development. While the full architecture is detailed in our [Docker Deployment](/deployment/docker) guide, the development setup is intentionally lighter and focused on developer experience.

## Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
-   Git installed
-   Basic understanding of Docker concepts

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JhumanJ/OpnForm.git
    cd OpnForm
    ```

2. Run the setup script in development mode:

    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/docker-setup.sh
    ./scripts/docker-setup.sh --dev
    ```

    This script will:

    - Pull or build required Docker images
    - Start all containers in development mode with embedded configuration
    - Display access information

    <Note>
        Development mode doesn't require .env files - all configuration is
        embedded in docker-compose.dev.yml for simplicity.
    </Note>

3. Access your development environment:
    - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (direct access to Nuxt dev server)
    - **API**: http://localhost/api (proxied through nginx)

### Initial Setup

After starting the development environment, OpnForm will automatically redirect you to a setup page where you can create your admin account. Simply visit `http://localhost:3000/setup` and you'll be guided through the setup process.

<Note>
    Public registration is disabled in the self-hosted version after setup is
    complete. Use the admin account to invite additional users.
</Note>

## Architecture

The development setup is intentionally simplified compared to our [Docker Deployment](/deployment/docker) production setup, with a focus on developer experience and faster iteration.

### Key Simplifications

-   **No .env Files**: All configuration embedded in docker-compose.dev.yml - no environment file generation needed
-   **Direct Frontend Access**: Frontend runs on port 3000 with direct access, bypassing nginx proxy
-   **Lightweight nginx**: Only handles API routes and Laravel backend, eliminating redundant frontend proxying
-   **Simplified networking**: Fewer moving parts, cleaner logs, easier debugging

### Differences from Production

-   **No Redis**: Uses file-based caching and sessions instead

    -   Simpler setup
    -   No additional service to maintain
    -   Slightly slower but sufficient for development

-   **No Queue Workers**: Uses synchronous job processing

    -   Jobs run immediately in the main process
    -   Easier debugging of background tasks
    -   No need to restart workers after code changes

-   **No Scheduler**: Scheduled tasks don't run automatically

    -   Run scheduled tasks manually when needed
    -   Less resource usage
    -   Cleaner logs

-   **Embedded Configuration**: No `.env` files needed

    -   All variables set directly in docker-compose.dev.yml
    -   Includes secure development keys (APP_KEY, JWT_SECRET)
    -   Pre-configured mail settings using log driver
    -   Immediate startup without setup scripts

### Development Features

The development setup includes:

#### Frontend Development

-   **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Changes to Vue components and styles are instantly reflected without page reload
-   **Vue DevTools**: Full integration for component inspection and state management debugging ([learn more](https://devtools.vuejs.org/))
-   **Source Maps**: Enabled for easier debugging
-   **Fast Refresh**: Preserves component state during updates
-   **Error Overlay**: Displays errors directly in the browser

#### Backend Development

-   **PHP Hot Reload**: Changes to PHP files are immediately available
-   **Xdebug Integration**: Ready for step-by-step debugging
-   **Artisan Commands**: Direct access to Laravel's CLI tools

#### Performance Optimizations

The development setup includes smart optimizations for faster iteration:

-   **Smart Dependency Install**: Automatically detects when `package.json` has changed and only reinstalls when necessary
    -   First startup: Full npm install (2-3 minutes)
    -   Subsequent startups: "Dependencies up to date, skipping install" (5 seconds)
    -   Automatic detection when dependencies change
-   **Persistent Node Modules**: Dependencies stored in Docker volumes to avoid reinstallation
-   **Fast Container Restarts**: Skip dependency installation on container restart

### Development URLs

-   **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000

    -   Direct access to Nuxt dev server with HMR
    -   Vue DevTools available
    -   All client-side routing handled directly

-   **API**: http://localhost/api
    -   Lightweight nginx proxy to Laravel API
    -   Routes all backend requests through Laravel's front controller
    -   PHP-FPM processing for server-side logic
    -   Supports file uploads and long requests

<Note>
    In development, nginx handles all Laravel routes (including `/`, `/api/*`,
    `/forms/*`) through the standard Laravel front controller pattern. The
    frontend is accessed directly on port 3000, eliminating redundant proxying.
</Note>

## File Structure

The development setup mounts your local directories into the containers:

```
OpnForm/
├── api/                    # Laravel API (mounted to api container)
│   ├── vendor/            # Preserved in container
│   └── storage/           # Mounted for logs and uploads
├── client/                # Nuxt frontend (mounted to ui container)
│   └── node_modules/      # Preserved in container
└── docker/                # Docker configuration files
```

## Common Tasks

### Running Commands

To run commands in the containers:

```bash
# Laravel Artisan commands
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api php artisan [command]

# NPM commands
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ui npm [command]

# Database commands
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec db psql -U forge
```

### Accessing Logs

View container logs:

```bash
# All containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Specific container (e.g., frontend)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f ui
```

### Database Access

The PostgreSQL database is accessible:

-   From containers: `host=db`
-   From your machine: `localhost:5432`
-   Default credentials:
    ```
    Host: localhost
    Port: 5432
    Database: forge
    Username: forge
    Password: forge
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### Container Issues

If containers aren't starting properly:

```bash
# Clean everything and restart
./scripts/docker-setup.sh --dev
```

### Frontend Access Issues

If you get **503 errors** when accessing the frontend:

<Steps>
<Step title="Use IPv4 address">
    Always use `http://127.0.0.1:3000` instead of `http://localhost:3000`
    
    <Warning>
    `localhost` can resolve to IPv6 (`::1`) on some systems, causing connection issues with Docker's port binding.
    </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Check container logs">
    Verify the Nuxt dev server started successfully: ```bash docker compose -f
    docker-compose.dev.yml logs ui ``` Look for: `"Dependencies up to date,
    skipping install"` and `"➜ Local: http://0.0.0.0:3000/"`
</Step>

<Step title="Restart containers if needed">
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart ui
    ```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Environment Variables

Development mode uses embedded configuration - no `.env` files needed:

-   **APP_KEY** and **JWT_SECRET**: Pre-configured development keys
-   **Database**: Defaults to `forge/forge` credentials
-   **Mail**: Uses log driver for development
-   **Storage**: Local filesystem with public visibility

To customize variables, edit them directly in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues:

```bash
# Fix storage permissions
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api chmod -R 775 storage

# Fix vendor permissions
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api chmod -R 775 vendor
```

### HMR Issues

If hot reload isn't working:

1. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
2. Ensure ports 3000 and 24678 are available
3. Try restarting the UI container:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart ui
    ```

### Dependency Installation Issues

If you need to force reinstall dependencies:

```bash
# Remove the install marker to force reinstall
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ui rm -f node_modules/.install-complete

# Or clear the entire volume
docker volume rm opnform_client_node_modules
```

## Environment Variables

For production deployments, see our [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment-variables#docker-environment-variables) documentation.

<Note>
    Development mode doesn't use `.env` files. All configuration is embedded in
    `docker-compose.dev.yml` for simplicity. To modify variables, edit the
    `environment:` section directly in that file.
</Note>
