## Overview

OpnForm provides a minimal Docker-based development environment optimized for local development. While the full architecture is detailed in our [Docker Deployment](/deployment/docker) guide, the development setup is intentionally lighter and focused on developer experience.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- Git installed
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JhumanJ/OpnForm.git
   cd OpnForm
   ```

2. Run the setup script in development mode:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/docker-setup.sh
   ./scripts/docker-setup.sh --dev
   ```

   This script will:
   - Create necessary environment files
   - Pull or build required Docker images
   - Start all containers in development mode
   - Display access information

3. Access your development environment:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost/api

### Initial Login

After starting the development environment, use these credentials to access the app:

-   Email: `admin@opnform.com`
-   Password: `password`

You will be prompted to change your email and password after your first login.

<Note>Public registration is disabled in the self-hosted version. Use the admin account to invite additional users.</Note>

## Architecture

While the full architecture is detailed in our [Docker Deployment](/deployment/docker) guide, the development setup is intentionally lighter and focused on developer experience.

### Differences from Production

- **No Redis**: Uses file-based caching and sessions instead
  - Simpler setup
  - No additional service to maintain
  - Slightly slower but sufficient for development

- **No Queue Workers**: Uses synchronous job processing
  - Jobs run immediately in the main process
  - Easier debugging of background tasks
  - No need to restart workers after code changes

- **No Scheduler**: Scheduled tasks don't run automatically
  - Run scheduled tasks manually when needed
  - Less resource usage
  - Cleaner logs

### Development Features

The development setup includes:

#### Frontend Development
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Changes to Vue components and styles are instantly reflected without page reload
- **Vue DevTools**: Full integration for component inspection and state management debugging ([learn more](https://devtools.vuejs.org/))
- **Source Maps**: Enabled for easier debugging
- **Fast Refresh**: Preserves component state during updates
- **Error Overlay**: Displays errors directly in the browser

#### Backend Development
- **PHP Hot Reload**: Changes to PHP files are immediately available
- **Xdebug Integration**: Ready for step-by-step debugging
- **Artisan Commands**: Direct access to Laravel's CLI tools

### Development URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
  - Direct access to Nuxt dev server
  - Includes HMR websocket connection
  - Vue DevTools available

- **API**: http://localhost/api
  - Handled by Nginx reverse proxy
  - Automatic routing to PHP-FPM
  - Supports file uploads and long requests

## File Structure

The development setup mounts your local directories into the containers:
```
OpnForm/
├── api/                    # Laravel API (mounted to api container)
│   ├── vendor/            # Preserved in container
│   └── storage/           # Mounted for logs and uploads
├── client/                # Nuxt frontend (mounted to ui container)
│   └── node_modules/      # Preserved in container
└── docker/                # Docker configuration files
```

## Common Tasks

### Running Commands

To run commands in the containers:

```bash
# Laravel Artisan commands
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api php artisan [command]

# NPM commands
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ui npm [command]

# Database commands
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec db psql -U forge
```

### Accessing Logs

View container logs:

```bash
# All containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Specific container (e.g., frontend)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f ui
```

### Database Access

The PostgreSQL database is accessible:
- From containers: `host=db`
- From your machine: `localhost:5432`
- Default credentials:
  ```
  Host: localhost
  Port: 5432
  Database: forge
  Username: forge
  Password: forge
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Container Issues
If containers aren't starting properly:
```bash
# Clean everything and restart
./scripts/docker-setup.sh --dev
```

### Permission Issues
If you encounter permission issues:
```bash
# Fix storage permissions
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api chmod -R 775 storage

# Fix vendor permissions
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api chmod -R 775 vendor
```

### HMR Issues
If hot reload isn't working:
1. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
2. Ensure ports 3000 and 24678 are available
3. Try restarting the UI container:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart ui
   ```
