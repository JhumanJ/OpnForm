## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JhumanJ/OpnForm.git
   cd OpnForm
   ```

2. Set up environment files:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-env.sh --docker
   ```

3. (Optional) Customize the environment variables:
   
   You can modify two environment files to customize your OpnForm installation:
   - The `.env` file in the `api` directory for backend configuration
   - The `.env` file in the `client` directory for frontend configuration

   For more information on available environment variables, please refer to our [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment-variables) page.

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Access OpnForm at http://localhost


### Initial Login

After installation, use these credentials to access the app:

-   Email: `admin@opnform.com`
-   Password: `password`

You will be prompted to change your email and password after your first login.

<Note>Public registration is disabled in the self-hosted version. Use the admin account to invite additional users.</Note>

## Docker Images

OpnForm provides pre-built Docker images for easy deployment. You can find our official Docker images on Docker Hub:

- [OpnForm API Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jhumanj/opnform-api)
- [OpnForm Client Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jhumanj/opnform-client)

We recommend using these official images for your OpnForm deployment.


## Building Your Own Docker Images

By default, OpnForm uses pre-built images from Docker Hub. However, if you want to build the images yourself (for development or customization), you have two options:

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

The simplest way to build the images is using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build
```

This will build all the necessary images. You can then start the application as usual:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Building Images Manually

You can also build the images manually using the provided Dockerfiles:

1. Build the API image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t opnform-api:local -f docker/Dockerfile.api .
   ```

2. Build the UI image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t opnform-ui:local -f docker/Dockerfile.client .
   ```

If you build the images manually, make sure to update your docker-compose.override.yml to use these local images (see below).

### Overriding Docker Compose Configuration

You can override the default Docker Compose configuration by creating a `docker-compose.override.yml` file. This allows you to customize various aspects of the deployment without modifying the main `docker-compose.yml` file.

Example `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    image: opnform-api:local
  ui:
    image: opnform-ui:local
  api-worker:
    image: opnform-api:local
```


### Clearing all resources

To completely remove all Docker containers, networks, and volumes created by Docker Compose and also remove all images used by these services, you can use the following command:

```
docker compose down -v --rmi all
```
