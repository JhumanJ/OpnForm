### When Should You Self-Host?

There are specific scenarios where self-hosting OpnForm might be the better choice:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: If you need an air-gapped environment for regulatory reasons (e.g., HIPAA compliance).
- **Custom Builds**: If you want to run a custom build or fork of OpnForm with your own customizations.
- **Custom Integrations**: If you need to use community or custom integrations that are not supported in the cloud version.

For most users, the managed OpnForm Cloud service will be the better option due to its ease of use, automatic updates, and comprehensive support.
