Welcome to the OpnForm API documentation. This guide provides information on how to interact with the OpnForm API to automate your workflows and integrate OpnForm with your applications.

## Authentication

To authenticate with the OpnForm API, you need an API key. Here's how to create and use an API key.

1. Log in to your OpnForm account.
2. Navigate to the Access Tokens page at https://opnform.com/settings/access-tokens.
3. Click on the "Create new token" button.
4. Give your token a name (e.g., "My API Integration").
5. Click "Create" to generate your API key. 6. Copy the generated API key immediately, as it won't be displayed again for security reasons.

### Using the API Key

To use the API key, you need to include it in the header of every request you make to the API as a Bearer token. Here's how to do it:

1. Take your API key that you generated earlier.
2. Add it to the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request.
3. Prefix the key with the word "Bearer" followed by a space.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
