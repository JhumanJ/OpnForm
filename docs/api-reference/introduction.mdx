Welcome to the **OpnForm REST API** – a straightforward, JWT-based interface that lets you manage workspaces, forms and submissions from your own tools or backend jobs.

If you've ever used the dashboard you already know the objects you'll be working with: **workspaces**, **forms**, **submissions**, and **users**. The API exposes almost the same capabilities – you can list items, create new ones, update them or delete them, all with predictable HTTP verbs.

## Base URL

```text
https://api.opnform.com
```

All endpoints documented in this reference are relative to that URL.

## Versioning

The current version is **v1** (implicit in the paths). We follow semantic versioning – backwards-compatible improvements don't bump the major version, breaking changes will.

## Authentication

Every request must include a **Personal Access Token** in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Tokens can be created in your OpnForm dashboard (see the [API Keys](./api-keys) section). Each token is associated with one or more **abilities / scopes** that restrict what it can do.

| Ability | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| workspaces-read | Read workspaces the user belongs to |
| workspaces-write | Create, update or delete workspaces |
| workspace-users-read | List workspace members & invites |
| workspace-users-write | Manage workspace members & invites |
| forms-read | Read forms & submissions |
| forms-write | Create or modify forms & submissions |

When your request attempts an operation outside the abilities attached to the token, the API responds with **403 Forbidden**.

## Pagination

List endpoints are paginated. The default page size is **100** items. Use the `page` query parameter (`?page=2`) to retrieve subsequent pages.

## Rate limits

Each IP address is limited to **1000 requests per minute**. Responses include the following headers so you can stay within the limit:

| Header | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Total requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests left in the current window |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying (only present when limit exceeded) |

Exceeding the limit returns **429 Too Many Requests**.

## Errors

Errors are returned in JSON with an HTTP status code that reflects the problem:

```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed.",
  "errors": {
    "title": ["The title field is required."]
  }
}
```

See the status-code table below for the most common cases:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 400 | Bad request / validation error |
| 401 | Missing or invalid token |
| 403 | Token lacks required ability |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Server error – something went wrong on our side |

That's all you need to know to get started – head over to the endpoint sections or grab a token and make your first call:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" https://api.opnform.com/open/workspaces
```
