Personal Access Tokens are the credentials you'll use to authenticate with the OpnForm REST API. They're scoped, revocable, and tied to your user account – **keep them secret**.

## Creating a token

1. Sign in to your OpnForm account.
2. Open **Settings → Access Tokens** (`/settings/access-tokens`).
3. Click **Create new token**.
4. Pick a descriptive name (e.g. "Zapier Integration").
5. Select the abilities you want to grant (see the table below).
6. Click **Create** and copy the token value – you **won't** be able to see it again after closing the dialog.

## Abilities

| Ability | Grants |
|---------|--------|
| workspaces-read | List workspaces |
| workspaces-write | Create, update or delete workspaces |
| workspace-users-read | List members and invites |
| workspace-users-write | Manage members and invites |
| forms-read | List forms and submissions |
| forms-write | Create or modify forms and submissions |

You can combine abilities as needed – choose the minimum set your integration requires.

## Using the token

Send the token in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

## Revoking a token

If a token is leaked or no longer needed:

1. Go back to **Settings → Access Tokens**.
2. Click **Revoke** next to the token.
3. Any further API requests that use that token will receive `401 Unauthorized`.

## Best practices

* Store tokens securely (environment variables, secret managers, CI secrets).
* Use a dedicated token per integration – easier to revoke individually.
* Avoid committing tokens to version control.
* Rotate tokens periodically.
