# Update Form

Update an existing form. You can modify any attribute that can be set when creating a form.

## Authentication & Scope

Requires a token with the `forms-write` ability.

## Request

```http
PUT /open/forms/{id} HTTP/1.1
Host: api.opnform.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                    |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|
| id        | number | Numeric ID of the form to edit |

### Body Parameters (partial)

All fields from the [Create Form](./create-form) endpoint may be supplied. Only the fields you include will be updated; omitting a field leaves its current value unchanged.

Important:

* Passing a new `slug` will regenerate the form URL (self-hosted only).
* The `workspace_id` can **not** be changed via this endpoint—use `/open/forms/{id}/workspace/{workspace_id}` instead.

Example:

```json
{
  "title": "Customer Feedback (v2)",
  "visibility": "draft",
  "properties": [
    {
      "id": "field-1",
      "type": "short_text",
      "name": "First name",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Response

`200 OK` – Returns the updated `Form` object.

`403 Forbidden` – The token lacks `forms-write` or you don't have permission.
