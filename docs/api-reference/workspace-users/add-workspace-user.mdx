## Response

`200 OK` – One of the following messages:

* `"User has been successfully added to workspace."` – when the user account already exists.
* `"Registration invitation email sent to user."` – when an invitation email was sent.
* `"User is already in workspace."` – if the user is already a member.

The response structure:

```json
{
  "message": "User has been successfully added to workspace."
}
```

`403 Forbidden` – Token lacks `workspace-users-write` or insufficient privileges.
