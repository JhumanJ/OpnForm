## Development Setup

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with OpnForm development is to use our Docker-based development environment. It provides:
- Hot-reload for both frontend and backend
- All necessary services pre-configured
- Consistent development environment across all platforms

Follow our [Docker Development Setup](/deployment/docker-development) guide to get started.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use Docker or need a custom setup, you can follow our [Local Deployment](/deployment/local-deployment#manual-setup) guide for manual installation instructions.
