## Getting started with OpnForm

The easiest way to get started with OpnForm is with the [official managed service in the Cloud](https://opnform.com/).

It takes 1 minute to try out the builder for free. You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you.

### Requirements

- PHP >= 8.0
- MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL
- Node.js and NPM/Yarn/... to compile assets

## Installation


### Docker installation üê≥

There's a `Dockerfile` for building a self-contained docker image including databases, webservers etc.

This can be built and run locally but is also hosted publicly on docker hub at `jhumanj/opnform` and is generally best run directly from there.

#### Running from docker hub

```
docker run --name opnform -v $PWD/my-opnform-data:/persist -p 80:80 jhumanj/opnform
```

You should now be able to access the application by visiting  http://localhost in a web browser.

The `-v` argument creates a local directory called `my-opnform-data` which will store your database and files so that your work is not lost when you restart the container.

The `--name` argument names the running container so that you can refer back to it later, with e.g. `docker stop opnform`.  You can use any name you'd like.


#### Using a custom .env file

If you have a custom env file you can use this like so:

```
docker run --name opnform -v $PWD/my-custom-env-file.env:/app/.env -v $PWD/my-opnform-data:/persist -p 80:80 jhumanj/opnform
```

This would load load in the env file located at `my-custom-env-file.env`, note that if you are creating a .env file for use like this it's best to start from the `.docker.env` example file as there are slightly different defaults for the dockerized setup.

#### Using a custom HTTP port

To run on port 8080

```
docker run --name opnform -v $PWD/my-opnform-data:/persist -p 8080:80 jhumanj/opnform
```

#### Building a custom docker image

To build a custom docker image from your local source code use this command from the root of the source repository:

```
docker build . -t my-docker-image-name
```

This should create a new docker image tagged `my-docker-image-name` which can be run as follows:

```
docker run --name opnform -v $PWD/my-opnform-data:/persist -p 80:80 my-docker-image-name

```

#### Upgrading docker installations

**Please consult the upgrade instructions for the latest opnform version**, e.g. if upgrading from v1 to v2 please check the v2 instructions as the process may change in future releases.

Normal upgrade procedure would be to stop the running container, back up your data directory (you will need this backup if you want to rollback to the old version) and then start a container running the new image with the same arguments.

e.g. if you're running from a specific opnform version with 

```docker run --name opnform -v $PWD/my-opnform-data:/persist -p 80:80 jhumanj/opnform:1.0.0```

You could run:

```
# stop the running container
docker stop opnform
# backup the data directory
cp -r my-opnform-data my-opnform-backup
# start the new container
docker run --name opnform-2 -v $PWD/my-opnform-data:/persist -p 80:80 jhumanj/opnform:2.0.0
```

Then if everything is running smoothly you can delete the old container with:
```
docker rm opnform
```

If you haven't specified a version e.g. if you are using the image `jhumanj/opnform` or `jhumanj/opnform:latest` you will need to run `docker pull jhumanj/opnform` or `docker pull jhumanj/opnform:latest` before starting the new container.


### Using Laravel Valet
This section explains how to get started locally with the project. It's most likely relevant if you're trying to work on the project.
First, let's work with the codebase and its dependencies.

```bash
# Get the code!
git clone git@github.com:JhumanJ/OpnForm.git && cd OpnForm

# Install PHP and JS dependencies
composer install && npm install

# Compile assets (see the scripts section in package.json)
npm run dev # or build
```

Now, we can configure Laravel. We just need to prepare some vars in our `.env` file, just create it with `cp .env.example .env` then open it!

Configure the desired database in the `DATABASE_` section. You can fine tune your installation on the [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x).

Run these artisan commands:

```bash
# Generate needed secrets üôà
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret # and select yes!

# Creates DB schemas
php artisan migrate
```
Now, create an S3 bucket (or equivalent). Create an IAM user with access to this bucket, fill the environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_BUCKET`. In your AWS bucket permissions, add the following under "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)": 
```json
[ { "AllowedHeaders": [ "*" ], "AllowedMethods": [ "PUT", "POST", "GET", "DELETE" ], "AllowedOrigins": [ "*" ], "ExposeHeaders": [] } ]
```

üéâ Done! Enjoy your personal OpnForm instance at: [http://opnform.test](http://opnform.test).
