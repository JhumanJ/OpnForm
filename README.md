## Getting started with OpnForm

The easiest way to get started with OpnForm is with the [official managed service in the Cloud](https://opnform.com/).

It takes 1 minute to try out the builder for free. You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you.

### Requirements

- PHP >= 8.0
- MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL
- Node.js and NPM/Yarn/... to compile assets

## Installation


### Docker installation üê≥

There's a `docker compose` setup automating most of the manual steps:

```bash
make up
```

The application is now running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
Alternatively, you may use the compose setup on its own

```bash
# Start the application
docker compose up -d server

# Run php commands, for example
docker compose run php-cli artisan about

# ...or update npm dependencies
docker compose run node-cli npm ci
```

`make` keeps track of all executed targets using `.make.*` files.
In case you'd like to start from scratch (re-install dependencies, reset jwt
token, run migrations, ...), run

```bash
make clean
```

After that, `make` will re-execute all targets upon the next execution.

### Using Laravel Valet
This section explains how to get started locally with the project. It's most likely relevant if you're trying to work on the project.
First, let's work with the codebase and its dependencies.

```bash
# Get the code!
git clone git@github.com:JhumanJ/OpnForm.git && cd OpnForm

# Install PHP and JS dependencies
composer install && npm install

# Compile assets (see the scripts section in package.json)
npm run dev # or build
```

Now, we can configure Laravel. We just need to prepare some vars in our `.env` file, just create it with `cp .env.example .env` then open it!

Configure the desired database in the `DATABASE_` section. You can fine tune your installation on the [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x).

Run these artisan commands:

```bash
# Generate needed secrets üôà
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret # and select yes!

# Creates DB schemas
php artisan migrate
```
Now, create an S3 bucket (or equivalent). Create an IAM user with access to this bucket, fill the environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_BUCKET`. In your AWS bucket permissions, add the following under "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)": 
```json
[ { "AllowedHeaders": [ "*" ], "AllowedMethods": [ "PUT", "POST", "GET", "DELETE" ], "AllowedOrigins": [ "*" ], "ExposeHeaders": [] } ]
```

üéâ Done! Enjoy your personal OpnForm instance at: [http://opnform.test](http://opnform.test).
