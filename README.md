## Getting started with OpnForm

The easiest way to get started with OpnForm is with the [official managed service in the Cloud](https://opnform.com/).

It takes 1 minute to try out the builder for free. You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you.

### Requirements

- PHP >= 8.0
- MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL
- Node.js and NPM/Yarn/... to compile assets

## Installation

### Docker Installation üê≥

OpnForm can be easily set up using Docker. Pre-built images are available on Docker Hub, which is the recommended method for most users.

#### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

#### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JhumanJ/OpnForm.git
   cd OpnForm
   ```

2. Set up environment files:
   ```
   cp .env.docker .env
   cp client/.env.docker client/.env
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access OpnForm at http://localhost

> üåê **Server Deployment Note**: When deploying to a server, configure the app URLs in both `.env` and `client/.env` files. Set `APP_URL` in `.env`, and both `NUXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` & `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` in `client/.env`.

#### Customization

- **Environment Variables**: Modify `.env` and `client/.env` files to customize your setup. For example, to enable email features, configure a [supported mail driver](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail) in the `.env` file.

#### Upgrading

1. Check the upgrade instructions for your target version in the documentation.
2. Update your `docker-compose.yml` file if necessary.
3. Apply changes:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Initial Login

After installation, use these credentials to access the admin panel:
- Email: `admin@opnform.com`
- Password: `password`

‚ö†Ô∏è Change these credentials immediately after your first login.

Note: Public registration is disabled in the self-hosted version. Use the admin account to invite additional users.

### Building from Source

For development or customization, you can build the Docker images locally:

1. Build the images:
   ```
   docker build -t opnform-ui:local -f docker/Dockerfile.client .
   docker build -t opnform-api:local -f docker/Dockerfile.api .
   ```

2. Create a docker-compose override file:
   ```
   cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
   ```

   Edit the `docker-compose.override.yml` file to use your locally built images:
   ```yaml
   services:
     api:
       image: opnform-api:local
     ui:
       image: opnform-ui:local
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This method allows you to make changes to the source code and rebuild the images as needed.

### Using Laravel Valet
This section explains how to get started locally with the project. It's most likely relevant if you're trying to work on the project.
First, let's work with the codebase and its dependencies.

```bash
# Get the code!
git clone git@github.com:JhumanJ/OpnForm.git && cd OpnForm

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install 
 
 # Install JS dependencies
cd client && npm install

# Compile assets (see the scripts section in package.json)
npm run dev # or build
```

Now, we can configure Laravel. We just need to prepare some vars in our `.env` file, just create it with `cp .env.example .env` then open it!

Configure the desired database in the `DATABASE_` section. You can fine tune your installation on the [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x).

Run these artisan commands:

```bash
# Generate needed secrets üôà
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret # and select yes!

# Creates DB schemas
php artisan migrate
```
Now, create an S3 bucket (or equivalent). Create an IAM user with access to this bucket, fill the environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_BUCKET`. In your AWS bucket permissions, add the following under "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)": 
```json
[ { "AllowedHeaders": [ "*" ], "AllowedMethods": [ "PUT", "POST", "GET", "DELETE" ], "AllowedOrigins": [ "*" ], "ExposeHeaders": [] } ]
```

üéâ Done! Enjoy your personal OpnForm instance at: [http://opnform.test](http://opnform.test).
