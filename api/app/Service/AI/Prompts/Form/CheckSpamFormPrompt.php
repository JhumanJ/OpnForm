        Analyze this form for spam/phishing. Focus on CONTENT RISK, not user characteristics.

        <formContent>
        {formContent}
        </formContent>

        <userInformation>
        User registered: {userRegisteredSince} days ago.
        User is subscribed: {isSubscribed}
        Total forms created: {totalFormsCreated}
        </userInformation>

        **BLOCK IMMEDIATELY (is_spam: true):**
        - Login forms impersonating major services (Gmail, PayPal, Facebook, Outlook, etc.)
        - Forms asking for existing passwords/credentials to "verify" accounts or for fake login
        - Clear brand impersonation with sensitive data collection

        **FLAG FOR ADMIN REVIEW (needs_admin_review: true) - RARE CASES ONLY:**
        - Forms with suspicious brand impersonation but unclear intent
        - Requests for highly sensitive data (SSN, banking details) without clear business purpose
        - Forms that appear to be testing system vulnerabilities

        **ALLOW (both false) - DEFAULT FOR MOST FORMS:**
        - Business inquiry forms, contact forms, surveys
        - Forms in any language (Arabic, Spanish, etc. are legitimate)
        - Forms from new users (being new is NOT suspicious)
        - Adult content related forms (unless clearly illegal)
        - Vague or simple forms (common for legitimate use cases)
        - New account creation forms (password setup normal)
        - Surveys, event codes, referral forms
        - General contact/support forms

        **IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
        - User age/registration date is NOT a spam indicator
        - Non-English content is NOT suspicious
        - Adult content is acceptable unless clearly illegal
        - Vague titles are common and legitimate
        - Login forms = phishing, Registration forms = often legitimate
        - Subscribed users get benefit of doubt
        - When uncertain, prefer allowing over flagging

        Classify as: SPAM (block), ADMIN REVIEW (flag), or LEGITIMATE (allow).
        Respond with JSON: {"is_spam": boolean, "needs_admin_review": boolean, "reason": "explanation"}

THIS USER HAS BLOCKING HISTORY - READ CAREFULLY:

**ABSOLUTE RULES FOR PREVIOUSLY UNBLOCKED USERS:**
1. ⛔ **NEVER re-block unless EXTREME violation** (login credential theft, clear brand impersonation with malicious intent)
2. 🔒 **Manual admin unblocks are SACRED** - an admin already reviewed and approved this user
3. ⚖️ **When in doubt, use 'needs_admin_review' instead of 'is_spam'** - let humans decide
4. 🎯 **Only block for OBVIOUS phishing** - password collection, fake login pages, credential harvesting

**DECISION PRIORITY:**
1. 🟢 ALLOW (both false) - Default for previously unblocked users
2. 🟡 ADMIN REVIEW (needs_admin_review: true) - Only if genuinely suspicious but not clearly malicious  
3. 🔴 BLOCK (is_spam: true) - ONLY for extreme violations that endanger other users
