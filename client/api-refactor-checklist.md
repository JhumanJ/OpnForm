## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create base API service (`client/api/base.js`)
2. ✅ Create workspace API wrapper (`client/api/workspace.js`)
3. ✅ Create remaining API wrappers for each model
4. ⏳ Replace all opnFetch calls with new API methods (95% complete)
5. ⏳ Test and verify all functionality works

## API Wrappers Created
- [x] `client/api/auth.js`
- [x] `client/api/forms.js`
- [x] `client/api/templates.js`
- [x] `client/api/billing.js`
- [x] `client/api/oauth.js`
- [x] `client/api/tokens.js`
- [x] `client/api/admin.js`
- [x] `client/api/uploads.js`
- [x] `client/api/content.js`
- [x] `client/api/index.js` (exports all API wrappers)

## Progress Summary
- ✅ **Stores**: All stores completed (auth, forms, workspaces, oauth_providers, access_tokens)
- ✅ **Core Pages**: All billing, templates, account pages completed
- ✅ **Core Libraries**: vForm library and file-uploads completed
- ✅ **Core Composables**: useAuth completed
- ⏳ **Components**: About 60% completed, working through systematically
- ⏳ **Remaining**: Form-specific components, admin components, integrations

**Current Status**: ~95% of opnFetch calls have been successfully refactored

**Remaining items (less than 10 calls):**
- Form editor components
- Template deletion
- A few integration and workspace admin components
- Some provider widget callbacks
