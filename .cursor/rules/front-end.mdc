You are an expert in Nuxt, Vue.js, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, NuxtUI library and Tailwind, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate code with relevant examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- No need to import Vue Reactivity APIs like ref or computed, as well as lifecycle hooks and helpers in .vue components, as they are auto-imported by Nuxt

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for functions.

We don't use typescript, javascript only (except when really required for config file for instance).

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions to benefit from hoisting and clarity.
- Always use the Vue Composition API script setup style. If a legacy file still used

## UI and Styling
- Use Nuxt UI components (https://ui.nuxt.com/components) and Tailwind for components and styling. Ex: <UModal>, <UPopover>, <UToolTip>, <UBadge> etc... Essentially use NuxtUI for everything but for form components.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Build UI components using atomic design principles, organizing them from smallest to largest (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms, pages).
- Icons: use the <Icon> component, and for icon names always use `i-library-icon` syntax.

Forms
- For forms inputs, use the components in client/components/forms such as <TextInput> etc.
- Wrap then in @VForm.vue

Auto-imports

Performance Optimization
- Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.
- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI made with <USkeleton/> components.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.

Key Conventions
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.
- Implement proper error boundaries or try-catch mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, especially in asynchronous operations.
